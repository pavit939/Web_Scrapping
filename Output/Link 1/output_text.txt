Our processes are streamlined and platform-driven, leaving very little room for unintended manual errors. We have dedicated teams with specialized skill sets in defined service categories such as copyediting and proofreading. They are experienced in producing publications in the varied fields of Science, Technical, Medicine (STM), education, social sciences etc. covering the breadth of academic and scholarly publishing, and continually keep themselves updated on changes in standards and technology advances. Our services spectrum includes Editorial Services, Data Services, Artwork & Design and end-to-end Project Management. Editorial Services Exeter’s Editorial Services can help you achieve editorial excellence, so that you can stand out and succeed in your publishing goals. We are experts in the business of publishing content and have perfected the art and science of editorial nuances which meets the needs of publishers and authors looking for highest quality and quick turnaround times. Machine learning underlies our editorial processes – thus ensuring high degree of quality and constantly evolving capability. Copyediting We can turn your good book into a great book through workflow-driven, collaborative and comprehensive copyediting services. We give primacy to retaining the author’s voice and understanding the context through direct interactions with authors. Machine learning-driven examination of the text for flow, grammar, errors, repetitions, style mismatch or any other inconsistencies ensures a fine copy. The checks provided include – Spelling, including UK and US English Grammar, including rephrasing sentences References and footnotes for the style of the publishing, technical accuracy and placement of citations Appropriate and consistent captioning for figures and tables Mathematical equations for subscripts, superscripts, exponents and symbols Proofreading Proofreading is perhaps the most important step in producing a ready-for-publication book or journal. Exeter’s highly proficient team ensures that this crucial check of the copyedited text produces output that is consistent, complies with the publisher’s house style and meets the highest standards.  Apart from checking for typical errors in style, fonts,  capitalisation, italicisation, hyphenation, correct usage of symbols (for example in equations), we also ensure consistency of typefaces and hierarchies.  Be it journal articles, books, PhD theses, dissertations, or proposals in the STM field – we proofread and produce polished content. Indexing An index is not a collection of mere keywords or phrases, but an organized map of contents, including cross-references, grouping of like concepts and other useful information for intellectual analysis (especially, for non-trade publications). The absence of it may make even a good subject content go unnoticed by the reader. Exeter’s professional indexers ensure your content is indexed comprehensively with related concepts in different sections of the book being cross-referenced or grouped. We can create simple, keyword based, flat (single-level) author and subject indexes to complex, topical, multi-level indexes for content-intensive books or other publications that increase the value of your publication manifold. Data Services Exeter’s Data Services help publishers go digital. Backed by more than 15 years of experience, our data conversion services enable you to not only create new publication but also migrate your existing print versions to multiple digital formats. We can be your single point of contact and can ensure successful content conversions from various data sources in any typeset format as needed by you without compromising on quality. Typesetting Our typesetting and page composition services are based on XML-first workflow that preserves the integrity of the XML file throughout the various stages of the production cycle ensuring that the XML file is compliant to the publisher’s DTD at any stage, which means that the XML can be generated literally on demand. These end-to-end page composition services catering to books and STM journals range from simple text pages to those containing complex mathematical equations; single column to multi-column and single colored to multi-colored presentation. We are well-versed in 3B2, InDesign, LaTeX, QuarkXPress and XSL-FO. Data Conversion We can convert any composite material such as equations and tables, from any page composition software (such as HTML, Adobe InDesign, QuarkXpress, MS Word) or even hard copies to XML, HTML, MS Word, PDF and ebook formats (PDF, ePUB, Mobipocket, KF8, Nook etc). Our innovative, systematic and best-practice based data capture, archival imaging, metadata creation, DTD/schema development to XML transformation means our data conversion services are of high standards, delivered on time while meeting all your unique requirements. We provide ebook conversion, DTBook conversion – Digital Accessible Information System ( DAISY) and National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard ( NIMAS), XML Conversion, PubMed Conversion Services and more.
